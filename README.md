# Data-Structures-Access-Model-for-Remote-Shared-Memory

Recent achievements in high-performance computing have significantly narrowed the performance gap between single and multi-node computing, and opened up opportunities for systems with remote shared memory. The combination of in-memory storage, remote direct memory access and remote calls requires rethinking how data can be organised, protected and queried in distributed systems.

Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is used in achieving high-bandwidth, low-latency communication between the nodes in a distributed system via distributed hash tables. This repository includes a practical demonstration of the applications of hash tables through the use of a C program, that shows how they can be utilised in real-world scenarios, such as storing the Aadhaar Card details of individuals in a database.
